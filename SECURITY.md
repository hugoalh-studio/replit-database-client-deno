## Report Vulnerability

If you believe you have found any security vulnerability, please report it via the [Security Advisories system](https://github.com/hugoalh-studio/replit-database-client-deno/security/advisories/new) instead of create an issue and/or report it publicly.

All new reports may need `~48 hours (~2 days)` to begin the process.
